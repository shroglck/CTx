# CTx
Code for CTx-Net for vedio actiton recognition under occlusion

### Installation

The code uses **Python 3.9** and it is tested on PyTorch GPU version 1.11, with CUDA-11.6

### Setup CTx-Net Virtual Environment

```
virtualenv --no-site-packages <your_home_dir>/.virtualenvs/CTx
source <your_home_dir>/.virtualenvs/CTx/bin/activate
```

### Clone the project and install requirements

```
git clone https://github.com/shroglck/CTx.git
cd CTx
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download models

* Download pretrained CompNet weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eeRTvCUwqekM0cJl0fWcIenFAjVL24bH/view?usp=share_link) and copy them inside the **models** folder.




 

#### Evaluate the classification performance of a model

Run the following command in the terminal to evaluate a model on the full test dataset:
```
python Code/test.py 
```


## Initializing CTx-net Parameters

CTx-Net parameters (vMF kernels and mixture models ) are initialized by clustering the feature vectors

```
python vc_cluster_fine.py
``` 

Furthermore, we initialize the mixture models by EM-type learning.
The initial cluster assignment for the EM-type learning is computed based on the similarity of the vMF encodings of the training images.
To compute the similarity matrices use:
 
```
python simmat_finer.py
``` 

Similarly the mixture model weights can be learned using
```
python mix_model_lear_finer.py
```
To train the model
```
python compose_trainer_2.py
```
